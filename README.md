# StarWarsUniverse


This project is a Star Wars themed web app. The homepage shows a paginated list of all characters in the Star Wars universe which includes basic character information such as name, gender, height, and species. Clicking on a character on the homepage redirects to another page with a list of all the films the character has appeared in. Information about the films include the name, episode id, director and release date.
